My name is Truxtun, and I like to fancy myself a Network Engineer. I've been configuring and maintaining networks for around 5 years at this point, and have managed two large scale networks, containing 500 and 200 network devices, and supporting 10k and 5k users respectively. I've created this website as a means to keep track of my projects and research, along with hopefully exposing others to some cool things. Please contact me if you have any questions or sugestions at my [email](redi@protonmail.com). I'm always interested in learning a better or different way to do things!

This website has been created using an awesome thing called [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
