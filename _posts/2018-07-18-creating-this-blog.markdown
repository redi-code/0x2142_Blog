Before I even begin to get into anything else, I want to share the awesome services that let me create this blog so easily.

The first and biggest service is Github. Github is an amazing tool that while being targeted at programmers, can be and is used by a swathe of others. The specific service that I'm going to gush over here is Github Pages. Pages lets you host a website for free. All you have to do is create a github account and repository containing the website information. [Github Pages](pages.github.com) walks you through it step by step. 

The second is [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which is an easy static, blog-aware website generator. It's documentation is very simple to follow and the blog creation is intuitive as it can get. For some reason, I've always been averse to website creators like Wordpress and Wix. I had read too many things about vulnerabilities and just plain bad coding when they were used. Along with that aversion, I love the idea of open source software. Jekyll is simple, lightweight and open source. It lets me focus on what I actually want to express and explain without distracting me every step of the way with learning how to represent it. I'm no web designer, and Jekyll allows me to get away with not being one.

It makes me extremely happy that people are creating tools like these and letting others spread their knowledge so easily.
Check them out, and maybe even join me!
